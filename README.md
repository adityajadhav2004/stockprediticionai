# Stock Signal AI by Aditya Jadhav

Stock Signal AI fetches real-time news feeds, analyzes them using advanced AI models (DeepSeek/DeepRouter), and provides you with a buy, sell, or hold signal for any stock depending on the latest news sentiment and facts.

**How it works:**  
Stock Signal AI continuously gathers the latest news articles and financial reports about your chosen stock. It then sends this information to state-of-the-art AI models (DeepSeek/DeepRouter) that are specifically tuned for financial analysis. The AI reviews the news, fact-checks claims, and determines the likely impact on the stock price. Based on this, it gives you a clear, actionable signal: **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**.

**Why is it created?**  
- **AI-Driven, Not Just Data-Driven:**  
  Unlike traditional stock screeners that rely only on historical price data or basic sentiment, Stock Signal AI uses advanced language models to understand the context, tone, and facts in real news articles.

- **Fact-Checking:**  
  The system doesn't just summarize newsâ€”it verifies claims and highlights which information is certain and which is speculative, giving you more confidence in the signals.

- **Real-Time, News-Based Signals:**  
  Instead of waiting for end-of-day or delayed data, you get insights as soon as news breaks, helping you act faster than the market.

- **No Hardcoded Rules:**  
  The AI adapts to new events, trends, and language, so it can catch signals that rule-based systems miss.

- **Purely Based on News:**  
  Stock Signal AI is purely driven by real-time financial news. It uses the News API and DeepRouter/DeepSeek to generate intelligent news-based stock predictions. No technical indicators or historical price data are used.

## Recent Updates (June 2025)

- **Exchange Dropdown:** You can now select between NSE and NASDAQ stocks directly in the search bar for more accurate results and suggestions.
- **Response Method Selection:** Choose between OpenRouter AI and Serper (Google) as the response provider, blended into the search bar for convenience.
- **Robust AI Fallback:** If OpenRouter/DeepSeek cannot provide a summary, the backend will automatically try Serper (Google) to ensure you always get a real, fact-based summary for any valid stock.
- **Terminal Logging:** The backend logs which AI or API (OpenRouter, Serper) provided the response for each request.
- **Input Trimming:** Extra spaces in stock names are automatically removed before processing.
- **Security:** API keys (including Serper) are never pushed to the repo and must be set in `.env.local` (which is gitignored).
- **Bug Fixes:** Prevented runtime errors when no news is found by providing safe defaults for all result fields.
